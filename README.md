Before you use these instructions, review the installation instructions for your printer. If it’s a new printer, you can probably find a quick-start guide included in the box. If you're reinstalling the printer driver for an older printer, go to the manufacturer’s web site and look for the printer manual, which is often in the site’s support pages.

Here are some simple step by step directions for installing a printer on your computer:

* Click on the Start button, select Devices and then, select Printers.
* Select Add Printer.
* From the Add Printer dialog box, click Add a Local Printer and select Next.
* Choose a Printer Port - You can select from a drop down of existing ports or use the recommended port setting that your computer selects for you.
* Click Next.
* Add your driver. From here, you can either add the disc that came with your printer or select the driver that you downloaded from the manufacturer’s website.
* Name your printer.
* Click Finish.
* Run a test print.

## Using a Printer Driver Installation Program

While relatively rare these days, some printers might require you to run a printer driver installation program rather than allowing Windows to install the driver on its own.

To do so, go to the manufacturer’s web site and look for the printer driver download file (often found in the Support section). Download the file and double-click it to run the installation and setup. Follow the instructions, and you'll be up and running in minutes.

## What to do if the driver doesn't install?

1. Right-click Start , then select Settings  > Apps > Optional features.
 * Open Optional features
2. Select View Features.
3. In the search box, type "Windows Fax and Scan."
4. Select the check box next to Windows Fax and Scan in the results and select Next.
5. Select Install.

## How to update printer drivers

Windows 10

1. Go to Control Panel
2. Click on ‘Hardware and Sound’
3. Click on ‘Device Manager’ to show all of the connected hardware on your machine – look for the ‘Printers’ drop-down which will contain any relevant printers
4. Right click the printer you want to update the drivers on and click ‘Update driver’
5. Choose whether to search for drivers automatically or manually – choose automatically unless you have already downloaded the latest drivers or have them on external storage
6. If Windows doesn’t find a new driver, you can look for one yourself on the manufacturer’s website and download before installing manually
7. Run the installer to complete the set-up.

Windows 7

1. Go to Control Panel
2. Search for ‘Device Manager’ and click it in the results to show all of the connected hardware on your machine
3. Find your connected printer in the list of devices – it’ll usually be under ‘Ports (COM and LPT)’ or ‘Universal Serial Bus’
4. Right click the printer and open up ‘Properties’
5. Choose the ‘Driver’ tab and click ‘Update Driver’ – choosing to find new drivers automatically or locally on your computer

macOS

1. Choose Apple menu
2. Select System Preferences
3. Click Printers & Scanners
4. Select your printer from the list then click the Remove button (-)
5. Click the Add button (+) and if a pop up menu appears, choose Add Printer or Scanner
6. Select your printer when it appears on the list, then do one of the following:
 * **Use AirPrint:** If you connected an AirPrint-enabled printer using a USB cable, click the Use pop-up menu then AirPrint. If AirPrint isn’t on the menu your printer doesn’t support it.
7. Use printer software installed on your Mac or downloaded from Apple: Click the Use pop-up menu then choose Select Software
8. Use printer software from a file on your Mac: Click the Use pop-up menu, then choose Other. Select the file then click Add.
